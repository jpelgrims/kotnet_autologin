# Kotnet autologin

A script for automatically logging into kotnet. Simply run the script and it will try to reach to webportal and log in. The script will check periodically to see if the kotnet session has been aborted and fix it. More information can be found [here](https://jellepelgrims.com/posts/kotnet_autologin).
